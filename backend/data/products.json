Ayurveda is an ancient Hindu medical system still practiced in many parts of the world that has provided modern researchers with a wealth of botanical products to evaluate. To help optimize respiratory health, Lung-Saver™ combines several natural ingredients with an educational guide to help support healthy lungs.\r\n\r\nRespiratory Problems\r\n\r\nRespiratory problems can have an impact on every aspect of health because while some take the ability to breathe easily for granted, for many restricted breathing is a constant obstacle to daily activity. Obstruction in the lungs can cause a decrease in the exhaled air flow. This is caused by a narrowing or blockage of the airways, which can be an indication of unhealthy respiratory function. Respiratory restrictions can also cause a decrease in the total volume of air that the lungs are able to hold. This can be due to a decrease in the elasticity of the lungs themselves or caused by a problem related to the expansion of the chest wall during inhalation. Restricted breathing can be exhausting and impact every aspect of daily life. The inability to breathe freely keeps many from enjoying every day pursuits and physical activity.\r\n\r\nThere are many things that may cause respiratory distress:\r\n\r\nAsthma\r\nBronchitis\r\nEmphysema\r\nSmoking\r\nEnvironmental pollution\r\nOccupational contaminants",
